Step-by-step guide for deriving Copay HD Multisig addresses and creating a transaction manually using only offline tools

- Initial draft of deriving Copay HD Multisig addresses using only tools that can be run offline and are not dependent on Bitpay infrastructure (bip32.org,dcpos.github.io/bip39, and coinb.in)
- Includes basic instructions for creating a transaction manually using those same tools
- May work for other BIP32/39/44 wallets also if the derivation path is known (not tested at all)
